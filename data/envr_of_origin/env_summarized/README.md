# Environment-of-Origin Data Summary Statistics

Data in this folder represent summary statistics for salinity and temperature at all environments-of-origin. Data are further divided into folders for temperature summary statistics and salinity summary statistics. The list of variables in each file is listed below.

## Variables for data sets in the Temperature folder
**Note**: All temperature metrics are given in degrees Celsius (Â°C)
- Mean_Annual_Temperature_C: average of all available temperature data 
- Mean_max_temperature_C: average of maximum temperatures for each year
- Mean_min_temperature_C: average of minimum temperatures for each year
- Temperature_st_dev: standard deviation of all available temperature data
- Temperature_n: total number of temperature data points
- Temperature_years: number of years represented in data set

## Variables for data sets in the Salinity folder
**Note**: All salinity metrics are given in parts per thousand (ppt)
- Mean_Annual_Salinity_ppt: average of all available salinity data
- Mean_min_Salinity_ppt: average of minimum salinities for each year
- Mean_max_Salinity_ppt: average of maximum salinities for each year
- Salinity_st_dev: standard deviation of all available salinity data
- Salinity_n: total number of salinity data points
- Salinity_years: number of years represented in data set
