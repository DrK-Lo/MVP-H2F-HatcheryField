# Full temperature
This folder contains one file for each environment-of-origin whose offspring survived in the hatchery. Temperature measurement frequency varies by site, and each file contains the full set of temperature data that we have access to. Note that these are not the raw environmental data, but rather data sets that have been made edited from the raw files so that each file has the same three following columns:
1. site_name: a two or four letter abbreviation for the site the data are for.
2. datetime: the date and time temeperature data in a given row were collected.
3. temp: water temperature in degrees Celsius (Â°C)
