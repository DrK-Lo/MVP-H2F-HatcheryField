# Full salinity
This folder contains one file for each environment-of-origin whose offspring survived in the hatchery. Salinity measurement frequency varies by site, and each file contains the full set of salinity data that we have access to. Each file has the following columns:
1. site_name: a two or four letter abbreviation for the site the data are for.
2. datetime: the date and time salinity data in a given row were collected.
3. salinity: salinity in parts per thousand (ppt)
