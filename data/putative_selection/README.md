# Putative Selection
Data in this folder help answer the question: What regions of the genome are putatively under spatially heterogeneous selection? 

# Question for KB from MGE
Do you want the full SNP set of parental genetics to be stored in this folder, or in the parental genetics structure folder?
I'm going to put the thinned SNP set, .lfmm project files, and the PCA data into the parental genetics structure folder. For now I'll also put the full SNP set in there. But let me know if you want that (or a duplicate copy of that) in this folder. 


## lfmm2 results
model parameterized with thinned SNP set (104k), then run on full SNP set (154k) with K=3. q-values were used to select significant outlier SNPs (n = 13897) with an FDR rate of 0.05. Genes (n = 1338) were generated from outlier SNP positions by cross-referencing Affx-IDs with mutation matrix annotations. ShinyGO gene ontology analysis mapped 1241 IDs to 1239 genes with a minimum pathway size of 2 and a maximum pathway size of 5000.
