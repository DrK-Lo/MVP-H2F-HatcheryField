# Putative Selection
Data in this folder help answer the question: What regions of the genome are putatively under spatially heterogeneous selection? 

# Question for KB from MGE
Do you want the full SNP set of parental genetics to be stored in this folder, or in the parental genetics structure folder?
I'm going to put the thinned SNP set, .lfmm project files, and the PCA data into the parental genetics structure folder. For now I'll also put the full SNP set in there. But let me know if you want that (or a duplicate copy of that) in this folder.
