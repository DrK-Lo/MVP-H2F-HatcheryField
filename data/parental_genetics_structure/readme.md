All data files related to parental genetic structure 


| File | Contents | How it's generated | Code used to generate |
|------|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `20250604_mutmatrix_PASS.rds` | SNP annotation data (Affx.ID, Chromosome, Position) for the 195,025 SNPs that passed the all-NA filter. | Filtered from the original SNP chip annotation by removing SNPs with 100% missing data across all individuals. | updated_genetics_experimental.R |
| `20250604_experimentalmatrix.rds` | Genotype matrix (160 individuals × 195,025 SNPs) for experimental adult broodstock only. Values are 0/1/2 allele codes. | Subset from the full 1,182-individual genotype matrix. | updated_genetics_experimental.R |
| `20250604_exp_indsmatrix.rds` | Metadata for the 160 experimental adults — includes sample IDs, clean_ID, sequencing QC stats, phenotype data (shell length, sex, mortality), site info. | Created by merging sequencing facility data, broodstock CSVs, and extraction plan data, then subsetting for experimental samples. | updated_genetics_experimental.R |
| `20250604_samp_full_subset_exp.rds` | Same 160 experimental individuals' metadata, reordered to match the genotype matrix row order. Adds a `Plate` column. | Created by semi-joining `exp_indsmatrix` with the genotype matrix on `clean_ID`, then reordering to align rows. | updated_genetics_experimental.R |
| `20250604_FULLmuts_exp.rds` | SNP annotation for the 154,102 SNPs that passed both the 10% missingness filter AND the 5% MAF filter, ordered by chromosome position. | Filtered from `mutmatrix_PASS` by removing SNPs with >10% missing data and <5% MAF in the experimental subset. | updated_genetics_experimental.R |
| `20250604_FULLSNPs_exp.rds` | Imputed genotype matrix (160 × 154,102) — no missing data remaining. Values are 0/1/2. This is the full (not LD-thinned) imputed SNP set. | Created by running SNMF imputation (K=2) on the MAF-filtered experimental genotypes. | updated_genetics_experimental.R |
| `20250604_THINNEDSNPs_exp.rds` | An integer vector of column indices (length ~105,356) identifying which of the 154,102 SNPs survive LD pruning. Not a matrix — just indices. | Output of `snp_autoSVD()` with r² threshold of 0.2. | updated_genetics_experimental.R |
| `20250606_FULLSNPs_exp_labeled.rds` | The same imputed 154,102 SNP matrix but with column names (Affx.IDs) added back. | Not shown in this script. | |
| `20250606_THINNEDSNPs_exp_labeled.rds` | The LD-thinned subset of the imputed matrix with column names added. | Not shown in this script. | |
| `20250604_pca_data_exp.csv` | PCA results — 160 rows with PC1–PC6 scores, plus `Plate` and `ID_SiteDate` columns for plotting. | Extracted from the `snp_autoSVD` PCA output, merged with sample metadata. | updated_genetics_experimental.R |
| `20250204geno_imputedfile_exp.geno` | The LD-thinned imputed genotypes (160 × 105,356) in LEA's `.geno` text format (0/1/2 values, no headers). Used as input for SNMF ancestry analysis. | Created by subsetting `FULLSNPs_exp` with the `THINNEDSNPs` indices, then writing with `write.geno()`. | exp_structure_analysis.Rmd |
| `20250204geno_imputedfile_exp.snmfProject` | LEA's SNMF project file — stores the K=2 ancestry analysis configuration, cross-entropy values for 10 repetitions, and Q-matrices for each run. | Output of `snmf()` run on the `.geno` file with K=2 and 10 repetitions. | exp_structure_analysis.Rmd |
| `20250204geno_imputedfile_exp.snmf/` | Directory containing the individual SNMF run output files (ancestry coefficient files, log files) referenced by the `.snmfProject` file. | Automatically generated by LEA when `snmf()` is run. | exp_structure_analysis.Rmd |
