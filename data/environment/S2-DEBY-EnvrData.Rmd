knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}

### Load required packages. 
```{r}
library("dplyr") #Used for working with data frames
library("lubridate") #Used for time-date conversions
library("readr") #Used to read the CSV file
library("ggplot2") 
```

### Note the date of data download and source. All available data should be used for each site regardless of year. Note from the CSV file how often the site was sampled, and if there are replicates in the data. Also describe if the sampling occurred at only low tide, only high tide, or continuously.  
```{r}
#Data was downloaded on 04/02/2024
#Source - http://vecos.vims.edu/StationDetail.aspx?param=DEBY005.40&program=CMON
#The site was sampled continuously every 15 min from 2003

#Create text strings with metadata information that we want to include in the final data frame. 
download_date <- ("04-02-2024")
source_description <- ("Virginia Estuarine and Coastal Observing System, VIMS")
site_name <- ("DEBY") 
collection_type <- ("continuous")
```

### Use the file path name in your working directory or desktop, see example below. Or, import data set through the "Files" window in R studio. Store the file in a variable with the "raw_ID_Site" format. If salinity and temperature data are in separate files, read in both and store them with "_sal" or "_temp" in the variable names. 
```{r}
#The files we will be working with are from Gloucester Point, VA, which is for the DEBY selection line. The ID_Site for this site is DEBY. 

#Environmental data could only be downloaded by year, so first we need to merge the yearly data sets.

combine_york_data <- function(directory) {
  years <- 2003:2024
  file_names <- paste0(directory, "/York_", years, ".csv")
  data_list <- lapply(file_names, function(f) {
    if (file.exists(f)) {
      read.csv(f, stringsAsFactors = FALSE, fill = TRUE)
    } else {
      warning(paste("File not found:", f))
      return(NULL)
    }
  })
  
  combined_data <- do.call(rbind, data_list)
  return(combined_data)
}

# Example usage
raw_DEBY_env <- combine_york_data("/Users/madelineeppley/GitHub/MVP-H2F-HatcheryField/data/environment") 

#The metadata for these data (located at the bottom of this site: http://vecos.vims.edu/Content.aspx?idContent=44) explain the various error codes listed alongside observations that are unusable or questionable. Error codes for a certain water quality observation are listed in a column titled WATERQUALITY_A, where WATERQUALITY is whatever aspect of water quality is being measured. For example, next to the SALINITY column is SALINITY_A, which lists error codes for salinity observations if applicable. Blank or NA WATERQUALITY_A cells indicate no error code is applicable. We need to remove observations marked with these codes by keeping only data with blank cells or NA in these columns.

subset_DEBY_env_error <- subset(raw_DEBY_env, select = c(SAMPLE_DATETIME, WTEMP, WTEMP_A, SALINITY, SALINITY_A)) #subset data to include sample collection day and time, water temperature, water temperature error codes, salinity, and salinity error codes

subset1_DEBY_env <- subset_DEBY_env_error[(subset_DEBY_env_error$WTEMP_A %in% c("", NA)), ] #keep only rows where the WTEMP_A columns are blank or NA, i.e. where there were no error codes recorded for the temperature data, and save it to a new data frame

subset2_DEBY_env <- subset1_DEBY_env[(subset1_DEBY_env$SALINITY_A %in% c("", NA)),] #keep only rows where the SALINITY_A columns are blank or NA, i.e. where there were no error codes recorded for the salinity data, and save it to a new data frame

#View(subset2_DEBY_env)
#sorting the data frame by ascending and descending values for WTEMP_A and SALINITY_A shows only blank cells or NA for each of those columns. We have removed the data marked with error codes

subset_DEBY_env <- subset(subset2_DEBY_env, select = c(SAMPLE_DATETIME, WTEMP, SALINITY)) #remove WTEMP_A and SALINITY_A from the dataframe now

# View how the data are stored. Note the variable names and the format and units that the data are stored in.  

summary(subset_DEBY_env)

#rename columns. "datetime" = date and time of data collection, "temp" = water temperature in degrees C, "salinity" = water salinity in parts per thousand (ppt)

colnames(subset_DEBY_env) <- c("datetime", "temp", "salinity")
```

### Start with the date and time of collection. We will use the lubridate package to standardize all values into the date-time format called POSIXct. This format stores the date and time in number of seconds since a past point (1/1/1970). This makes comparisons easy and helps to standardizes values. 
```{r}

#Convert to POSIXct format. Tell R what the current date/time format is so it knows how to convert it. Store it into a column named datetime in the data frame.
subset_DEBY_env$datetime <- as.POSIXct(subset_DEBY_env$datetime, "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %p", tz = "")


#Print the new data frame and examine to make sure the new datetime column is in the correct format. 
#head(subset_DEBY_env)
```


### #Standardize column and variable names. We will use "lat" for latitude in degrees, and "lon" for longitude in degrees. 

```{r}

#Store variables that we will include in the final data frame
lat <- 37.247284
lon <- -76.499369
firstyear <- 2003
finalyear <- 2024
```


### Filter any of the variables that have data points outside of normal range. We will use 0-40 as the accepted range for salinity (ppt) and temperature (C) values. Note, in the summer, salinity values can sometimes exceed 40. Check to see if there are values above 40. In this case, adjust the range or notify someone that the site has particularly high salinity values. 
```{r}
#Filter the data between the values of 0 and 40 for both salinity and temperature. 
filtered_DEBY_sal <- subset_DEBY_env %>%
    filter(between(salinity, 0, 40)) 

summary(subset_DEBY_env)
           
filtered_DEBY_env <- filtered_DEBY_sal %>%
    filter(between(temp, 0, 40))

# Sanity check - print the ranges to ensure values are filtered properly. We can see that the ranges for both are now in the appropriate range.  
print(summary(filtered_DEBY_env$salinity)) 
print(summary(filtered_DEBY_env$temp))

#Store our data into a variable name with just the site name. 
DEBY_env <- filtered_DEBY_env

# we have NAs in the our data frame in the datetime column - need to remove these
count.nas_env <- is.na(DEBY_env$datetime) # store our NAs in a variable
summary(count.nas_env) # we have 152 NAs that are stored as "TRUE" in our count.nas

nrow(DEBY_env) # figure out how many rows we have in the original df: 667345
which(count.nas_env == TRUE) # find the number of NA rows that we need to remove: 152
DEBY_env <- na.omit(DEBY_env) #remove NAs using na.omit
nrow(DEBY_env) #there are 667193 rows in the new data frame
check_env <- 667345 - 667193#the value of the check should be 152
check_env #we removed 152 NA rows!

# check for NAs in our temperature column
count.nas_temp <- is.na(DEBY_env$temp) # store our NAs in temp in a variable
summary(count.nas_temp) # we have 0 NAs

#check for NAs in our temperature column
count.nas_sal <- is.na(DEBY_env$salinity) #store our NAs in salinity in a variable
summary(count.nas_sal) #we have no NAs
```

#Data sets for violin plots
```{r}
#add site name and create new data frame with full envr data set
DEBY_env_full <- DEBY_env %>% 
  mutate(site_name, site_name = "DEBY")

#reorder columns with site_name first
DEBY_env_full <- DEBY_env_full[, c(4, 1, 2, 3)]

DEBY_temp_full <- DEBY_env_full[, c(1,2,3)]

DEBY_sal_full <- DEBY_env_full[, c(1, 2, 4)]

#save DEBY_temp_full and DEBY_sal_full as csv files for future analyses
write.csv(DEBY_temp_full, "../../data/envr_of_origin/full_temp/DEBY_temp_full.csv", row.names = FALSE)

write.csv(DEBY_sal_full, "../../data/envr_of_origin/full_sal/DEBY_sal_full.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```

### Visualize the salinity, temperature, and date ranges over time. This can help us see if there are any anomalies or gaps in the data and make sure the filtering was done correctly. Sanity check - do the temperature and salinity ranges look appropriate for the geography of the site (ex. near full ocean salinity for coastal sites, lower salinity for estuaries or near rivers)?

```{r salinity-plot}

#salplot <- ggplot(DEBY_env, aes(x = datetime)) +
    #geom_line(aes(y = salinity, color = "Salinity (ppt)")) +
    #ylim(0,40) +
    #labs(x = "Time", y = "Salinity ppt", title = "Salinity Plot for DEBY - Gloucester Point, Virginia") +
    #scale_color_manual(values = c("Salinity (ppt)" = "blue")) +
    #theme_minimal()


#salplot
```


```{r temperature-plot}
#tempplot <- ggplot(DEBY_env, aes(x = datetime)) +
    #geom_line(aes(y = temp, color = "Temperature (C)")) +
    #ylim(0, 40) +
    #labs(x = "Time", y = "Temperature C", title = "Temperature Plot for DEBY - Gloucester Point, Virginia") +
    #scale_color_manual(values = c( "Temperature (C)" = "red")) +
    #theme_minimal()

#tempplot
```

### We need to calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum values for salinity and temperature per month and year. First make two data frames to contain each of the annual and monthly averages.
```{r}
#Calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum values for salinity and temperature for each month. 
DEBY_envrmonth_sal <- DEBY_env %>%
    mutate(year = year(datetime), month = month(datetime)) %>%
    group_by(year, month) %>%
    summarise(
      min_salinity = min(salinity),
      max_salinity = max(salinity),
      mean_salinity = mean(salinity),
      length_salinity = length(salinity))
      
DEBY_envrmonth_temp <- DEBY_env %>%
    mutate(year = year(datetime), month = month(datetime)) %>%
    group_by(year, month) %>%
    summarise(      
      min_temp = min(temp),
      max_temp = max(temp),
      mean_temp = mean(temp),
      length_temp = length(temp))
  
print(DEBY_envrmonth_sal)
print(DEBY_envrmonth_temp)


#Calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum values for salinity and temperature for each year. 
DEBY_envryear_sal <- DEBY_env %>%
    mutate(year = year(datetime)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarise(
      min_salinity = min(salinity),
      max_salinity = max(salinity),
      mean_salinity = mean(salinity))

DEBY_envryear_temp <- DEBY_env %>%
    mutate(year = year(datetime)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarise(
      min_temp = min(temp),
      max_temp = max(temp),
      mean_temp = mean(temp))

print(DEBY_envryear_sal)
print(DEBY_envryear_temp)

#Calculate the mean, maximum, and minimum values for salinity and temperature for each day. 
DEBY_envrday <- DEBY_env %>%
    mutate(year = year(datetime), month = month(datetime), day = day(datetime)) %>%
    group_by(year, month, day) %>%
    summarise(
      min_salinity = min(salinity),
      max_salinity = max(salinity),
      mean_salinity = mean(salinity),
      length_salinity = length(salinity),
      min_temp = min(temp),
      max_temp = max(temp),
      mean_temp = mean(temp),
      length_temp = length(temp))
  
print(DEBY_envrday)

```

### Plot the months and years of data collection to check if there are any collection gaps in the data.
```{r timeplot - salinity}
#timeplot <- ggplot(DEBY_envrmonth_sal, aes(x = year)) +
    #geom_point(aes(y = month, color = length_salinity), size = 4) +
    #labs(x = "Time", y = "Month", title = "Salinity Timeplot for DEBY - Gloucester Point, Virginia") +
    #ylim(1,12) +
    #theme_minimal()

#timeplot
```

### Plot the months and years of data collection to check if there are any collection gaps in the data.
```{r timeplot - temperature}

### We can now calculate a list of variables that we will have collected for all sites. This will allow us to compare sites easily. We will calculate the number of observations from each site, the mean annual, maximum annual, and minimum annual value for all variables. 

Our list of variables includes: 

- Mean_Annual_Temperature_C: average of all available data
- Mean_max_temperature_C: average of maximums for each year
- Mean_min_temperature_C: average of minimums for each year
- Temperature_st_dev: standard deviation of all available data
- Temperature_n: total number of data points
- Temperature_years: number of years in data set

- Mean_Annual_Salinity_ppt: average of all available data
- Mean_min_Salinity_ppt: average of minimums for each year
- Mean_max_Salinity_ppt: average of maximums for each year
- Salinity_st_dev: standard deviation of all available data
- Salinity_n: total number of data points
- Salinity_years: number of years in data set
