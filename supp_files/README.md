| **Supplementary File 1** `[TBD]` | Full annotation file for the 200K SNPs on the Affymetrix OysterCVI200K array. | *Placeholder* | |
| **Supplementary File 2** `supplementary_snp_info.csv` | SNP-level annotation for the 154,102 SNPs that passed missingness (<10%) and MAF (>5%) filters in the experimental dataset. Columns include Affx.ID, Name, Sequence (flanking sequence with bracketed alleles), Chromosome (1–10), Position, SNPType (IUPAC ambiguity code), tiling/replicate info, organism, custom gene IDs and names, OysterCV membership, mutID (Chromosome_Position), and `in_thinned_set` (yes/no flag indicating whether the SNP survived LD pruning. | The mutation annotation matrix (`mutmatrix_PASS`) was filtered for SNPs with <10% missingness and >5% MAF in the 160 experimental adults, ordered by chromosome and position, and a column was added flagging SNPs present in the LD-thinned set (~105,356 SNPs). | Fstats_experimental.Rmd |
| **Supplementary File 3** `supplementary_genotypes.vcf` | VCF file containing the imputed genotype matrix for 160 experimental adult broodstock across 154,102 SNPs. `#CHROM`, `POS`, `ID`, `REF`, and `ALT` fields are populated from the SNP annotation; REF and ALT alleles are assigned based on the first and second alleles in the Affymetrix flanking sequence bracket notation (e.g., `[C/T]` → REF=C, ALT=T). Genotypes are encoded as GT values (0/0, 0/1, 1/1) converted from the 0/1/2 imputed matrix, where 0 = homozygous reference as defined in the original Affymetrix VCF output. No missing data remain after SNMF imputation (K=2, mode method). | The imputed full SNP genotype matrix (`FULLSNPs_exp`) was matched to SNP annotations, REF/ALT alleles were parsed from the flanking sequence column, genotypes were converted from 0/1/2 to VCF GT format, and the file was written with standard VCF v4.2 headers. | Fstats_experimental.Rmd |
| **Supplementary File 4** `Q2_all_model_results.csv` | Combined results table for all genotype–environment models (Q2) examining the effects of parental genetic diversity (observed heterozygosity, allelic richness) and environment-of-origin conditions on survival, shell length, and condition index across two common garden sites (Lewisetta, York River) and three field timepoints (November 2023, May 2024, November 2024). Includes two modeling approaches: (1) environmental quantiles (salinity and temperature Q10/Q90) and (2) environmental distance between environment-of-origin and common garden site. Each row represents one predictor from a final reduced model. Columns include response variable, model approach, site, timepoint, model class (lm for survival, lmer with bag random effect for length and CI), predictor name, unscaled and scaled estimates with standard errors, test statistic (t for lm, Wald χ² for lmer), p-value, significance level, and variables dropped during backward model selection. | Final reduced models were fit for each response × site × timepoint combination using backward selection (via `drop1()` for lm or `step()` for lmer). | Q2_envr_quantile_models_field.Rmd, Q2_envrdist_models_field.Rmd, Q2_condition_index_models_field.Rmd |
| **Supplementary File 5** `full_SNPs_outliers_annotated.csv` | Annotated SNP-level F-statistics and outlier results for the 154,102 MAF-filtered SNPs. Includes per-SNP expected heterozygosity (He), FST estimates (corrected and uncorrected), mean allele frequencies, p-values (including right-tail), q-values, and an outlier flag from the FST outlier scan. Merged with full SNP annotation (Affx.ID, chromosome, position, flanking sequence, SNPType) and gene-level annotation (scaffold, gene ID, gene description, GO IDs, GO terms). | FST outlier analysis was performed using OutFLANK on the MAF-filtered imputed genotype matrix. Results were merged with the SNP annotation matrix and genome annotation (scaffold positions, gene IDs, GO terms). | muts_reannotation.Rmd |
| **Supplementary File 6** `shinyGO_enriched.csv` | Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment results for genes associated with FST outlier SNPs. Columns include enrichment FDR, number of genes in the input list matching the pathway, total pathway gene count, fold enrichment, GO pathway ID and name, and the list of gene IDs (LOC identifiers) in each enriched term. Enriched pathways span biological processes (e.g., transmembrane transport, signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, G protein-coupled receptor signaling), molecular functions (e.g., DNA-binding transcription factor activity, protein kinase activity, ATP binding), and cellular components (e.g., membrane, nucleus, dynein complex). | Gene IDs from FST outlier-associated SNPs were submitted to ShinyGO for GO enrichment analysis. | GO_experimental.Rmd |
