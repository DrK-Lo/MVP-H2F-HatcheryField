| File | Contents | How it's generated | Code used to generate |
|------|----------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Supplementary File 1** `[TBD]` | Full annotation file for the 200K SNPs on the Affymetrix OysterCVI200K array. | *Placeholder* | |
| **Supplementary File 2** `supplementary_snp_info.csv` | SNP-level annotation for the 154,102 SNPs that passed missingness (<10%) and MAF (>5%) filters in the experimental dataset. Columns include Affx.ID, Name, Sequence (flanking sequence with bracketed alleles), Chromosome (1–10), Position, SNPType (IUPAC ambiguity code), tiling/replicate info, organism, custom gene IDs and names, OysterCV membership, mutID (Chromosome_Position), and `in_thinned_set` (yes/no flag indicating whether the SNP survived LD pruning at r² < 0.2). | The mutation annotation matrix (`mutmatrix_PASS`) was filtered for SNPs with <10% missingness and >5% MAF in the 160 experimental adults, ordered by chromosome and position, and a column was added flagging SNPs present in the LD-thinned set (~105,356 SNPs). | supp_files.Rmd |
| **Supplementary File 3** `supplementary_genotypes.vcf` | VCF file containing the imputed genotype matrix for 160 experimental adult broodstock across 154,102 SNPs. `#CHROM`, `POS`, `ID`, `REF`, and `ALT` fields are populated from the SNP annotation; REF and ALT alleles are assigned based on the first and second alleles in the Affymetrix flanking sequence bracket notation (e.g., `[C/T]` → REF=C, ALT=T). Genotypes are encoded as GT values (0/0, 0/1, 1/1) converted from the 0/1/2 imputed matrix, where 0 = homozygous reference as defined in the original Affymetrix VCF output. No missing data remain after SNMF imputation (K=2, mode method). | The imputed full SNP genotype matrix (`FULLSNPs_exp`) was matched to SNP annotations, REF/ALT alleles were parsed from the flanking sequence column, genotypes were converted from 0/1/2 to VCF GT format, and the file was written with standard VCF v4.2 headers. | supp_files.Rmd |
