|------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| survival_calc_field.Rmd | Calculates cumulative oyster survival across 3 monitoring events (November 2023, May 2024, November 24) at two field sites. Merges bag, mortality, and spawn treatment data, and computes per-bag survival recursively. Plots survival through time. | `MVP23-FieldBags-bags.csv`, `MVP23-FieldBags-mortality.csv`, `MVP23-FieldBags-sites.csv`, `MVP23-FieldBags-spawn_trt2.csv` | **Data (CSV):**<br>`mortality_long_popsite_h2f_<date>.csv` (long-format mean survival by site×pop×event),<br>`mortality_bags_h2f_<date>.csv` (wide-format per-bag survival at t0–t3) |
| length_calc_field.Rmd | Calculates oyster shell length across 3 monitoring events at two field sites. Merges bag, tag, and tag-length data, computes bag-level and population-level mean lengths by site and event, and plots length through time. | `MVP23-FieldBags-bags.csv`, `MVP23-FieldBags-sites.csv`, `MVP23-FieldBags-spawn_trt2.csv`, `MVP23-FieldBags-tags.csv`, `MVP23-FieldBags-tagsLength.csv` | **Data (CSV):**<br>`lengths_long.csv` (individual-level length data),<br>`lengths_bags_022025.csv` (bag-level mean lengths)<br><br>**Results (TXT):**<br>`len_sites_02202025.txt` (population mean lengths by site and event) |
| Q1_nursery_performance.Rmd | Analyzes pre-deployment (day 77) shell length at end of nursery stage. Runs ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer post-hoc tests on shell length by population. Produces boxplot figure with significance letters. | `CviMVP_Larvae_Growth-spawn_trt.csv`, `CviMVP_Larvae_Growth-group.csv`, `CviMVP_Larvae_Growth-larvae_img.csv` | **Data (CSV):**<br>`nursery_length.csv` (cleaned late-stage larval length data)<br><br>**Figures (PDF):**<br>`FigS3_nursery_length.pdf` |
| condition_index_analysis.Rmd | Fits linear mixed-effects models for condition index (CI) with site, population, and their interaction as fixed effects and bag as random effect. Runs emmeans pairwise comparisons with Tukey adjustment for May and November 2024 timepoints. Produces scatter plots of tissue vs. shell dry weight by population/site/grouping. | `MVP_phenotyping_final.csv` | Exploratory plots and model outputs (no saved data files or named figure outputs) |
| Q1_condition_survival_length_figures.Rmd | Creates figures for condition index, survival, and shell length at the final field monitoring event (November 2024). Reads in model results and significance letters, produces boxplots by population×site with Tukey significance annotations. | `MVP_phenotyping_final.csv`,<br>`field_surv_final_time2026-01-03.csv` (from Q1_field_performance_models.Rmd),<br>`field_length_final_time_2026-01-03.csv` (from Q1_field_performance_models.Rmd) | **Figures (PDF):**<br>`FigS4_field_ci.pdf` (condition index by population×site),<br>`field_surv.pdf` (survival by population×site),<br>`field_len.pdf` (shell length by population×site) |
| Q1_field_performance_models.Rmd | Models differences in survival and shell length using linear (mixed) models. Tests effects of population, site, and time on survival (LM) and length (LMM with bag as random effect). Then models drivers of performance using parental genetic diversity (Ho, allelic richness) and environment-of-origin (temperature/salinity quantiles and SDs) as predictors, separately by site and time point. Uses backward stepwise selection with VIF checks for multicollinearity. | `mortality_long_bags_h2f_2025-07-23.csv`, `MVP23-FieldBags-bags.csv`, `lengths_long.csv` (from length_calc_field.Rmd),<br>`parent_genetic_effects.csv` (from Fstats_experimental.Rmd),<br>`quantiles_05232025.csv` (environmental data) | **Data (CSV):**<br>`field_surv_all_times<date>.csv`, `field_surv_final_time<date>.csv` (survival with Tukey letters),<br>`field_length_all_times_<date>.csv`, `field_length_final_time_<date>.csv` (length with Tukey letters)<br><br>**Results (TXT):**<br>`survival_model_results_<date>.txt`, `survival_GE_model_results_<date>.txt`, `length_model_results_<date>.txt`, `len_GE_model_results_<date>.txt` |
