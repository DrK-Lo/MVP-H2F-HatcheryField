### Objective

The goal of this file is to re-annotate SNPs in the mutation-level data frame for our 200K SNP chip.
This re-annotated SNP data frame can be sliced into thinned and full SNP sets and used for multiple projects. 

### Packages

```{r}

# install relevant packages
#BiocManager::install(c("rtracklayer", "GenomicRanges", "biomaRt"))

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(rtracklayer)
library(GenomicRanges)
library(biomaRt)

```

### Load data

```{r}

# Load in mutation data frame
# MGE produced this file in /MVP-H2F-HatcheryField/src/parental_genetics/updated_genetics_experimental.R (big merge file that is also saved in other places)

muts <- readRDS(file.path("..", "..", "data", "parental_genetics_structure", "20250604_mutmatrix_PASS.rds"))

dim(muts) # 195,025 SNPs and 18 variables
names(muts)
head(muts)

```

```{r}

# figure out how many SNPs are annotated in the data frame as it is
annotated_only <- muts %>%
  filter(!is.na(cust_gene_id)) # down to 26,125

```

This tells us that only 26,125 SNPs out of 195025 were initially annotated, so it is important to re-annotate. 

### Re-annotation

Start by downloading the GFF3 file for the eastern oyster from Ensembl. Save it somewhere and import it here. 
Link to download: https://metazoa.ensembl.org/Crassostrea_virginica_gca002022765v4/Info/Index

```{r}

# I have this file saved in the MVP-H2F-HatcheryField repo but you can load it in from anywhere
gff <- rtracklayer::import(file.path("..", "..", "data", "putative_selection", "Crassostrea_virginica_gca002022765v4.C_virginica_3.0.62.gff3"))

```

Next step is to get the gene identifiers using the GenomicRanges package and the GFF3 file. 

```{r}

# our SNP dataframe uses numbers 1-10 for chromosomes but the GFF3 object has a different naming scheme - we need to make these match
muts$scaffold <- dplyr::case_when(
  muts$Chromosome == 1 ~ "CM008241.1",
  muts$Chromosome == 2 ~ "CM008242.1",
  muts$Chromosome == 3 ~ "CM008243.1",
  muts$Chromosome == 4 ~ "CM008244.1",
  muts$Chromosome == 5 ~ "CM008245.1",
  muts$Chromosome == 6 ~ "CM008246.1",
  muts$Chromosome == 7 ~ "CM008247.1",
  muts$Chromosome == 8 ~ "CM008248.1",
  muts$Chromosome == 9 ~ "CM008249.1",
  muts$Chromosome == 10 ~ "CM008250.1"
)

# filter for rows with position info filled in - we need this for reannotation
muts <- muts %>%
  filter(!is.na(Position)) # none removed

# convert the info from our muts data frame into a GenomicRanges object - stores genomic coordinates in a standardized way
snp_gr <- GRanges(
  seqnames = muts$scaffold,
  ranges = IRanges(start = muts$Position, end = muts$Position),
  snp_id = muts$Affx.ID
)

# filter to get just the gene entries in the GFF3 file (the file includes everything like mRNA, exons, etc.)
gene_features <- gff[gff$type == "gene"]

# find overlaps between our SNPs and genes in GFF3 file
hits <- findOverlaps(snp_gr, gene_features)

# create an annotation data frame
annotated <- data.frame(
  snp_id = snp_gr$snp_id[queryHits(hits)],
  gene_id = mcols(gene_features)$ID[subjectHits(hits)]
)

# merge annotation data frame back with original 
snp_annotated <- left_join(muts, annotated, by = c("Affx.ID" = "snp_id"))

print(sum(!is.na(snp_annotated$gene_id))) # 142,178 SNPs of 195,025 now annotated with gene IDs

# snp_annotated goes up to 198,269 rows - this is because some SNPs map to multiple genes. we will deal with this at the next step.

```

We now have way more gene IDs filled in. The next step is to connect to Ensembl online to query for biological information about our new gene IDs.

```{r}

# connect to the Ensembl Metazoa databse
mart <- useEnsemblGenomes(
  biomart = "metazoa_mart", 
  dataset = "cvgca002022765v4_eg_gene", # this is the label for the genome we want
  host = "https://metazoa.ensembl.org"
)

# first clean up the annotated SNP data frame 
snp_annotated$gene_id <- as.character(snp_annotated$gene_id)
# remove the "gene:" prefix from new gene_id values
snp_annotated$gene_id <- sub("^gene:", "", snp_annotated$gene_id)
# remove NAs as before
gene_ids <- unique(na.omit(snp_annotated$gene_id))

# query Ensembl Metazoa for the information we want. attributes = columns to grab, filters = how you want to search, values = our gene IDs, mart = database connection

# Column meanings:

# ensembl_gene_id: the official Ensembl gene ID
# description: functional description
# go_id: Gene Ontology ID
# name_1006: name/definition of the GO term

annotations <- getBM(
  attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "description", "go_id", "name_1006"),
  filters = "ensembl_gene_id",
  values = gene_ids,
  mart = mart
)

```

This created a longer than expected data frame because it's creating a new row for every GO term - so SNPs appear in the df more than once. I want to collapse this.

```{r}

annotations_collapsed <- annotations %>%
  group_by(ensembl_gene_id, description) %>%
  summarise(
    go_id = list(unique(na.omit(go_id))),
    go_term = list(unique(na.omit(name_1006))),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# now join this to SNPs (each SNP keeps its gene associations)
snp_annotated <- snp_annotated %>%
  left_join(annotations_collapsed, by = c("gene_id" = "ensembl_gene_id"))

```

The new re-annotated data frame (snp_annotated) is longer than the original data frame (muts).
Check for SNPs that are mapping to multiple genes and producing double entries 

```{r}

snp_gene_counts <- snp_annotated %>%
  filter(!is.na(gene_id)) %>% # goes down to our annotated set of 142178
  group_by(Affx.ID) %>%
  summarise(num_genes = n_distinct(gene_id)) %>%
  filter(num_genes > 1) # number of genes > 1 = 3181, number of genes > 2 = 62, number of genes > 3 = 1. 
                        # 3181 + 62 + 1 = 3244

# this calculation makes sense
dim(snp_gene_counts)  # 198,269 in the re-annotated set - 195,025 in the original set = 3244 SNPs are in multiple genes

dim(snp_annotated)

```

I want this data frame to be one row per SNP. So we need to find a way to collapse rows for SNPs that are in multiple genes while still being able to work with the data easily. 

```{r}

# this collpases the data frame into one row per SNP
snp_collapsed <- snp_annotated %>%
  group_by(Affx.ID, Name, Sequence, ) %>%
  summarise(
    Chromosome = first(Chromosome),
    Position = first(Position),
    genes = list(unique(na.omit(gene_id))),
    descriptions = list(unique(na.omit(description))),
    go_ids = list(unique(unlist(go_id))),
    go_terms = list(unique(unlist(go_term))),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# but, that format is not friendly for CSV. for SNPs in multiple genes, this code
# collpases the genes, annotations, and GO terms into one row per SNP, separated by semicolons
snp_collapsed_export <- snp_collapsed %>%
  mutate(
    genes = sapply(genes, function(x) paste(x, collapse = "; ")),
    descriptions = sapply(descriptions, function(x) paste(x, collapse = "; ")),
    go_ids = sapply(go_ids, function(x) paste(x, collapse = "; ")),
    go_terms = sapply(go_terms, function(x) paste(x, collapse = "; "))
  )

# data export
write_csv(
  snp_collapsed_export,
  file.path("..", "..", "supp files", "20251029_muts_reannotated.csv")
)

```

```{r}
# to recover the list structure, use this code: 
snp_reloaded <- read_csv(file.path("..", "..", "supp files", "20251029_muts_reannotated.csv")) %>%
  mutate(
    genes = strsplit(genes, "; "),
    go_terms = strsplit(go_terms, "; ")
  )

```
