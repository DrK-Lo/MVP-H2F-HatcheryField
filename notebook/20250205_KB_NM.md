- Review stats analysis section of methods
- Iron out survival data
  - Calculating survival for hatchery vs. field
- Unify output for Q1 and Q2 hatchery performance and field performance
  - Final time points and response variables to include from the hatchery and which to include from the field:
    - ABC: day 15-21 (end of hatchery), day 78 (end of nursery)
      - Survival for all of hatchery, but not for any of nursery
      - Have shell length for all of the above time points      
    - Field: Nov 2023, May 2024, Nov 2024
      - Have survival and shell length for all
    - "Winners" and "losers" in terms of survival and length in ABC are not the winners and losers in the field
  - Question 1: Top/bottom day 21 survival and shell length, top/bottom day 78 shell length, line plot for 3 field time points
    - Day 21/78 shell length/survival- box plots pls
    - For day 21 survival, can report values, but cannot run stats because only one data point per group - include survival from ABC?
  - Question 2: What are the response variables? End of hatchery stage performance, end of nursery stage performance, field site dates
    - Run model comparing envr and genetic parameters to length/survival for all the time points we have for those, don't need graphs for non-significant models 
- Question wording for "hatchery" - day 78 is not the hatchery
  
- Thought for results: brief few sentences on survival and shell length at end of hatchery stage (day 15-21), and then get into the stat results
  - Q1 and Q2 results start with day 78, exclude day 21 survival from stat analyses?
  - We think response variables should be the same for questions 1, 2, and 3 for clarity, and we can't run stat analyses on day 21 survival
  - Whatever we pick for qs 1 and 2, we'll make heatmaps for and run partial Mantel tests with Q3
