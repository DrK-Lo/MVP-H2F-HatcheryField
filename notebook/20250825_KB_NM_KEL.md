### Agenda
- Go over discussion outline
- Discuss Q1 and Q2 results paragraphs
  - How best to incorporate numeric results (I'm mainly struggling because there are so many) 
- Discuss adding another figure because we only have 4 and parts of some are getting cut (we would add Fst/environmental distance heatmaps)
- See if we like new version of figure 1
  - Salinity shown as heat maps instead of violin plots
- If time, try to work through some tough writing areas:
  - First paragraph of introduction - does it need another sentence?
  - First sentence of methods - how can we make this clearer?
  - Statistical analysis paragraphs - can we move a lot of this to the supplement? Are Q1 and Q2 methods accurate?
