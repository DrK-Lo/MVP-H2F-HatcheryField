Objectives: 
1. Madeline making new PCAs for environment of origin figure, including high/low salinity/temp stress day (also RDA if there is time, but not a priority)
2. Madeline will make correlation heat map looking at the environmental parameters (min/max/mean temp and salinity) in relation to all other environmental parameters
