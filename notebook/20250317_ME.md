### Environmental data & parental genetics figure updates (for the meeting following 3/14/25)

Objectives: 
1. Madeline making new PCAs for environment of origin figure, including high/low salinity/temp stress day (also RDA if there is time, but not a priority)
2. Madeline will make correlation heat map looking at the environmental parameters (min/max/mean temp and salinity) in relation to all other environmental parameters

# Correlation matrix for environmental data
## includes all experimental populations + selection lines LOLA and DEBY




# original environmental correlation matrix showing ALL variables
## many are correlated (which is why we thinned) to just min/max temperature and salinity

# lfmm2 and gene ontology results for the experimental adults


# environmental data analysis
## PCAs for the environment of origin sites 



# RDA analysis for the experimental adults
