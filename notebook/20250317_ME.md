### Environmental data & parental genetics figure updates (for the meeting following 3/14/25)

Objectives: 
1. Madeline making new PCAs for environment of origin figure, including high/low salinity/temp stress day (also RDA if there is time, but not a priority)
2. Madeline will make correlation map looking at the environmental parameters (min/max/mean temp and salinity) in relation to all other environmental parameters

# Correlation matrix for environmental data
## includes all environment-of-origins for the experimental parentals + environments at the selection lines LOLA and DEBY + environments at the field sites LEW and YORK

# original environmental correlation matrix showing ALL variables
## many are correlated (which is why we thinned) to just min/max temperature and salinity
