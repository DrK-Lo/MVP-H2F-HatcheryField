# Q2 Analayses Meeting notes
- NM: multiple regressions with the following explanatory variables:
  - length at day 21 (end of hatchery stage)
  - length at day 78 (end of nursery stage)
- CR: lmers focusing on t3 models
- Response variables are:
  - new environmental variables - quantile absed (0.9 quantile and 0.1)
  - .9 quantile salinity
  - .9 quantile temp
  - .1 quantile salinity
  - 0.1 quantile temp
 
- Whatever model we decide to start with will have reduced correlations between predictors
  - With new data from Madeline - temp quantiles are a little bit correlated
- Check for bouncing betas - run an individual variable model, make sure the slope is generally similar to the slope of that variable when in the multiple regression
- Ho is by far the largest slope, meaning largest impact on shell length out of the variables
  - see visualization idea from KEL
  - export estimates and p-values so we can make the figure recommended by KEL
    -   Probably want to have p values and estimates in separate tables
