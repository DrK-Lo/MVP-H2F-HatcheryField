### Agenda
- Q1 and Q2 methods and results - filling in gaps (Nicole, Camille, and Zea)
    - Q1 analyses/figures have all been done and most recent versions are in the manuscript.     
    - NM updated VIF and collinearity assessments for Q2 (genetics and environmental quantiles/ genetics and environmental distance to common garden sites), and updated CR's and ZS's analyses as needed.
    -  Q2 analyses (model 1 with envr quantiles and model 2 with envr distance) and figures (both main and supplemental) have been created.
        - Main manuscript: plots of slopes from model 1 field survival, plots of slopes from model 2 field survival
        - Supplement: Plot of slopes from model 1 hatchery/nursery length, plot of slopes from model 1 field length, plot of slopes from model 1 field condition, plot of slopes from model 2 field condition (CI plots are in the works, but should be done by tomorrow-NM)
        - NM did not make plots for length in the field vs. environmental distance because envr distance variables got dropped from all models.
    - Ensure the methods accurately describe Camille, Nicole, and Zea's code
- Review results for logical flow, emphasis on the right points, clarity, and conciseness
    - Review contents of the supplement as they come up during the results review 
- Decide how/if to present disease data
    - KEB note: I think the quasi-quantitative presentation of disease in Figure 1 is not adequate and will get flagged by reviewers. Madeline's qPCR data is obviously very informative but maybe somewhat ad hoc to include now? I think we should consider removing what we have now in Figure 1.
- Fill in anything in yellow highlighter!
- Sign up for your CRediT contributions
- Please add ORCIDs to top of paper
- Possibly revisit figure colors - they have gotten a bit all over the place

### If time (most likely not):
- Review methods for logical flow, clarity, and conciseness
- Review structure of introduction and use of the literature
- Brainstorm points for discussion

### Notes
- Figure 1 - Do we have all the Lewisetta data for the experiment (through December 2024). Need to check.
- Figure disease/survival/condition - instead of significance lines, show significance between Lewisetta and York only. Don't show significant differences between populations.
- Disease
      - Do we have data for the period of the experiment?
      - Disease data is complete with some 2023, all of 2024
      - Unable to plot it yet due to data format - this will take some work
      - What samples are we waiting for from Ryan?
      - This manuscript: disease data maximum in each year
- Scaling
    - Makes the slopes comparable, does not affect p-value. No need to scale survival data. Only the explanatory variable should be scaled.
- Figure survival/gen/env/slopes
    - Heterozygosity in panel D is potentially hard to explain
    - Bigger question: why is environmental distance positively correlated with survival?
    -  Environmental distance vs. survival between just the Gulf and everything else. Southern sites seem to be bringing it up.
    -  Similar plot for condition for supplement
Rationale for the paper
- Local is better, local isn't better. Use local, or use more similar environmental distance. Are you missing something if you don't have diversity? Do you need diversity or should you prioritize local?
- Word count is suitable for submission to a letters journal
- Switch PCA to FST
- Diseases are more prevalent in higher salinity - this could be why 0.1 salinity slope is positive
- Outstanding data: historical Lewisetta data for LOLA
