### Agenda
- Q1 and Q2 methods and results - filling in gaps (Nicole, Camille, and Zea)
    - Ensure alignment between Camille, Nicole, and Zea's code for things like VIF and collinearity
    - Ensure the methods accurately describe Camille, Nicole, and Zea's code
- Review results for logical flow, emphasis on the right points, clarity, and conciseness
- Review methods for the same, if time
- Decide how/if to present disease data
    - KEB note: I think the quasi-quantitative presentation of disease in Figure 1 is not adequate and will get flagged by reviewers. Madeline's qPCR data is much more informative but would be somewhat ad hoc to include now. I think we should consider removing what we have now in Figure 1.
