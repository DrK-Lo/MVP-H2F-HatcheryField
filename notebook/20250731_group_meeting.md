### Agenda
- Q1 and Q2 methods and results - filling in gaps (Nicole, Camille, and Zea)
    - Q1 analyses/figures have all been done and most recent versions are in the manuscript.     
    - NM updated VIF and collinearity assessments for Q2 (genetics and environmental quantiles/ genetics and environmental distance to common garden sites), and updated CR's and ZS's analyses as needed.
    -  Q2 analyses (model 1 with envr quantiles and model 2 with envr distance) and figures (both main and supplemental) have been created.
        - Main manuscript: plots of slopes from model 1 field survival, plots of slopes from model 2 field survival
        - Supplement: Plot of slopes from model 1 hatchery/nursery length, plot of slopes from model 1 field length, plot of slopes from model 1 field condition, plot of slopes from model 2 field condition (CI plots are in the works, but should be done by tomorrow-NM)
        - NM did not make plots for length in the field vs. environmental distance because envr distance variables got dropped from all models.
    - Ensure the methods accurately describe Camille, Nicole, and Zea's code
- Review results for logical flow, emphasis on the right points, clarity, and conciseness
    - Review contents of the supplement as they come up during the results review 
- Decide how/if to present disease data
    - KEB note: I think the quasi-quantitative presentation of disease in Figure 1 is not adequate and will get flagged by reviewers. Madeline's qPCR data is obviously very informative but maybe somewhat ad hoc to include now? I think we should consider removing what we have now in Figure 1.
- Fill in anything in yellow highlighter!
- Sign up for your CRediT contributions
- Please add ORCIDs to top of paper
- Possibly revisit figure colors - they have gotten a bit all over the place

### If time (most likely not):
- Review methods for logical flow, clarity, and conciseness
- Review structure of introduction and use of the literature
- Brainstorm points for discussion
