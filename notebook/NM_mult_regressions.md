# Multiple regressions for Q2 (effect of environment of origin and parent genetics on offspring performance)
- The explanatory variables for this question are:
  - mean minimum temp
  - mean maximum temp
  - mean minimum salinity
  - mean maximum salinity
  - average observed heterozygosity
  - average allelic richness 
-  I calculated correlation values and VIFs for the above variables. No variables had a correlation value higher than r = 0.7, but three VIFs were higher than 10
  - Mean min temp: VIF = 10.76
  - Mean max salinity: VIF = 13.54
  - Avg Ho: VIF = 15.04
- I ran test three linear models with length at day 21 as the response variable and excluded one of the above high-VIF variables in each lm
  - No real difference in homoscedasticity or outliers. Residuals were not normal for any models, BUT the model excluding mean minimum temperature had the highest p-value (Shapiro-Wilk test)
- There was one super low length entry from TX that was largely responsible for the normality issues, so I removed it and reran the above three models
  - Residuals still weren't normal, but normality was very much improved with the exclusion (p values from Shapiro Wilk tests were orders of magnitude higher than with the full data set)
- Model excluding mean min temp still had best normality, so I recalculated collinearity and VIF for the variables excluding mean min temp
  - Without mean min temp, no variables had r > 0.7, and no variable had a VIF higher than 10. Will use this model with a transformation for normality.
