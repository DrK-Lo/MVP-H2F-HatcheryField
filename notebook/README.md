# Notebook
This folder is for notebook entries related to planning, meeting notes, and information on figure creation and analyses. Please make a notebook entry for each figure to be included in the paper that includes the following:
- The figure
- A brief description of what the figure shows/any relevant trends or findings it demonstrates.
- A brief description of the process used to create the figure (what analyses were run, what data were incorporated).
  - Please be sure to provide links to the code file and data sets used to make the figure.
None of these figure entries need to be super long or detailed, we just want to have enough information to remember where all our results are coming from.
