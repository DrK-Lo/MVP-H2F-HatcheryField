# Meeting Planning for 03/14/2025

## Agenda
- Talk through figure ideas and select finalists
- Wondering how to group the field data for the partial Mantel tests for Q3
  - Should we group by bag or by field site? Basically how do we deal with the replicates?
- Q1: full model that looks for the interaction between group and time
    - Should we visualize differences between the field sites in figures for this question
    - Different degrees of freedom in hatchery vs. field ANOVA data
 - Q3: how to handle bags?
   - We will run partial Mantels (genetics controlling for environment + vice versa) on
       - Day 21 length
       - Day 21 survival
       - Day 78 length
       - Length at all field time points
       - Survival at all field time points
    - We will split field time point data by field sites.
    - Question is: even within a field site, there are multiple bags. How do we create one matrix from this data? Do we average values across bags for one group at each site (i.e. all the DEBY bags at the York site) even though those bags are independent?
  - Discuss disease analysis again - what info do we need?
    - Can do 1/0 for presence absence in terms of disease, but not very relevant since all sites have Dermo and almost all have MSX
      - Show instead as low/mid/high disease load? Or 0/1/2/3/4/5 - 0 is absent, 1 is rarely reported, 5 is occurs every year in high prevalence
      -  Could also use qPCR results to gauge disease data
  - NM: checked multicollinearity for multiple regressions - avg observed heterozygosity is borderline collinear with temperature (r = 0.68) and both have VIF over 5 - models with each of them without the other all have outliers and are not homoscedastic
    - I tried log transforming the response variable, and still issues with outliers and homoscedasticity   

Notes: 
- for environment of origin - put 3 PCAs under the violin/introgression plot to make 1 five panel plot
  - PCAs are: parent genetics, environmental data (field and envr of origin), and disease
  - ME advocates for including time series environmental plots in supplement
- ME will run RDA
- Treat hatchery as one analysis and field data as another - cannot run full interaction model looking at length ~ time and group for both hatchery and field sites together

  
- For Q1:
  - Boxplot for end of nursery length, interaction plot in supplement
  - See image of drawn out plots for Q1 figures
  - KEL recommends making each plot individually in R, then exporting as PDFs and arranging them in a PPT and exporting as PDF
 - Q2:
   - Camille has a LMM for each field time point length
   - NM - touch base with Camille
   - may just have to say that we cannot tease apart Ho from temperature
   - For salinity- is mean, min, or max salinity the biggest selective force
- Q3: Camille will average length/survival  


## By next meeting
   - Madeline making new PCAs for environment of origin figure, including high/low salinity/temp stress day
     - Madeline will make correlation heat map looking at the environmental parameters (min/max/mean temp and salinity) in relation to all other environmental parameters
   - Camille and Nicole (and Zea?) will talk about Q2 models, and Q1 figures (also consider incorporating Condition data from Zea)
   - Kiran - update the Q4 figures
   - Camille - add Tukey significance letters to final field boxplots
   - Kiran can update Mantels with new environmental variables
   - Nicole - send out calendar invite for 03/28 for next meeting
