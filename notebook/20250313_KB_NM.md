# Meeting Planning for 03/14/2025

## Agenda
- Talk through figure ideas and select finalists
- Discuss disease analysis again - what info do we need?
- Wondering how to group the field data for the partial Mantel tests for Q3
  - Should we group by bag or by field site? Basically how do we deal with the replicates?
- Q1: full model that looks for the interaction between group and time
    - Should we visualize differences between the field sites in figures for this question
    - Different degrees of freedom in hatchery vs. field ANOVA data
 - Q3: how to handle bags?
   - We will run partial Mantels (genetics controlling for environment + vice versa) on
       - Day 21 length
       - Day 21 survival
       - Day 78 length
       - Length at all field time points
       - Survival at all field time points
    - We will split field time point data by field sites.
    - Question is: even within a field site, there are multiple bags. How do we create one matrix from this data? Do we average values across bags for one group at each site (i.e. all the DEBY bags at the York site) even though those bags are independent?
