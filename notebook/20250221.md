# Meeting notes
- some colors similar in color scheme - can try using different shapes along with the colors
- test things out in this scheme and then we can adjust one or two colors if need be
- NM - check collinearity with multiple regressions, make sure normal distribution of residuals
- settle on model selection method - likelihood ratio test seems like the best option (better than AIC)
- Madeline has new plots for mean monthly temp and mean monthly salinity for environments of origin (excluding VA, DEBY, LOLA)
  - Also calculated number of stressful days based on temp and salinity (days with high and low temp, days with high and low salinity)
- Figure ideas:
  - Merge parental genetic and environmental plots into mega plot
  - May be able to do multivariate PCA with environment and genetics
    - probably will need to use monthly means/mins/maxes in terms of environmental data
    - can put site info on there as well
  - Lengths ar predep timepoint vs lengths at final field time point
    - boxplot similar to what is in the slide deck
    - Survival for day 21 in text, not graph
    - Manhattan/enrichment plots
  - leave Gulf of Mexico as is for now, can deal with any issues later
    - could also just say "the Gulf"
  - ANCOVA looking at field site, group
  - Next week: KB and NM draw out main figures for paper and put in results section
    - send to group by end of next week to have as discussion point for two weeks from now
