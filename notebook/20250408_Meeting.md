# Meeting Notes from Tuesday, April 8

Meeting participants: NM, KB, KEL, CR, ME, ZS
- Main topic: merits of splitting paper up into two manuscripts vs. keeping it as one.

## Notes:
- Word count can definitely get cut down, so don’t let that be the deciding factor
- Many interdisciplinary papers like this have massive supplements, so our plans for a large supplement isn’t out of the norm for projects like this
    - However, breaking things up into two papers will give us more space to deepen explanations of the data 
- Be cautious about splitting papers because once you do, you can’t go back
    - Keep compiling analyses for now and make final decision later
- For genetics paper - we could better answer the questions with seascape data
    - ME: still waiting on seascape data, experimental groups have representatives of the major geographic regions (Gulf, Southeast Atlantic, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic)
    - However, still want to be sure this doesn’t take away from chapter 1 of their dissertation
    - Opportunity to get training on genetic analysis techniques for ZS and NM
    - If we are going for Molecular Ecology journal for this one, we might need more ecological analyses for that anyway, which would take us back to the single manuscript
        - CR has published in Molecular Ecology with genetics and environment data, which we would also have for genetics manuscript
- Concern about getting everything done given that people will be graduating/moving on and folks will be in and out for periods over the summer
    - What is the back up plan/schedule when original deadlines don’t work out? Do we have the time for the extra time this project will take when split into two?
    - Risk consideration: How do we make sure that if we split up the manuscripts, the projects wouldn't get lost and never get finished? Can we make sure of this?
- Also consider that more manuscripts means more writing time needed and more time needed for Katie to give feedback
- Balance between two authorship credits on two lower impact papers vs one authorship credit on a higher impact paper that will likely get cited more
    - There’s a certain amount of control we get from having 2 authorship credits, which is valuable in the current job market
    - BUT at the cost of a more comprehensive, higher-regarded paper
- Ecology paper - if we do this, what journal would we aim for?
- Can include Katie in these discussions earlier on in the process in the future

## To do:
- Meeting on 4/11 to discuss current state of analyses (Zea absent for RISE)
- Let’s discuss what the narrative would be for the single manuscript soon (maybe 4/18?)
- Figure out what journals we'd aim for if we did two manuscripts and figure out if the manuscripts would be compatible with said journals?
