# Discussion Notes for Meeting on Friday
- Journal to aim for: Evolution, possibly Evolutionary Applications?
  - We like that the funding goes toward funding other research and fellowships
  - Broader audience is appealing, we recognize that the introduction will need to be broader to match this
- Question for KEL: is this the GitHub we are using for our own organization, or is this meant to be published at the end of the process?
  - If yes, we may want to reorganize based on analysis type
- Talk through GitHub organization - KB and NM will populate/update README files
  - Reminder that GitHub is for final versions of analyses, start to populate with final datasets
  - Feel free to create new folders to keep code, results, etc. organized
  - **src**: Please upload main code files and whatever datasets they require
    - If datasets were created via code files, please upload those code files as well
    - Remember principles of code reproducibility
  - **data**: see src section for what data to include here 
  - **notebook**: for meeting notes, analysis notes
    - For analyses: include major figures, brief interpretation/description of finding it shows, how you produced said figure(s) (i.e. models, analysis methods, etc.)
      - Linking code/data here would be super helpful
  - **figures**: pretty self-explanatory, any figures that may contribute to results should go here
- Review preliminary figures in slideshow
- Review methods if people have had time to write them
- Do we want a regular meeting time?
- Merge outline docs - we currently have 2
