# Meeting Notes: 2025-02-07
NM, KB, CR, ME, KEL

Agenda:
- Go through statistical analysis methods
  - Make sure everything looks good before running analyses
- Decide on the same response variables for Qs 1, 2, and 3 (hatchery and field)
  - Me and Nicole have ideas but want to make sure everyone agrees
- Show new graphs if time/if people have them
- Go through rest of methods if time

- Madeline will process field envr data to send to Camile
- Raw envr data in GitHub
- Sentinel environmental data in google drive (disease data)
  - Disease data will be used to help explain mortality in the York
  - Madeline gets to decide how to summarize disease data
- Camille- share field survival and shell length with Nicole/Kiran to run pairwise analyses on
  - have not linked tag to shell length- just looking at means for each group over time in the field, rather than individual performance
- Nicole - Camille's analysis is in src in GitHub
- Color scheme: selection lines and wild pops have slightly different colors
- Bar plot for field length? Definitely for survival
